Easiest way to install fltiny is by typing:

./configure
make
make install

If you want to compile tlf from the repo, please do a 

autoreconf --install

By default, fltiny will install into /usr/local/bin.

If you want to change any of these paths, you can do this with the
configure script too, e.g. './configure --prefix=/usr' will install
fltiny into /usr/bin.

To run it, just simple type:

fltiny runs in foreground, so it will not to give back the prompt.
If you want to run it in background, run it with "&" at the and of the

$ fltiny &


It will notify you and exit if any problem occures with serial port.
It will NOT notify, and DOESN'T exit, if any error occures with Fldigi.
If Fldigi unavailable (eg. you closed it), then fltiny runs away. If
you start again Fldigi, fltiny will realizes it, and work away.
