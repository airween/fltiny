fltiny now comes with automake and autoconf.

Easiest way to install fltiny is by typing:

./configure
make
make install

If you want to compile tlf from the repo, please do a 

autoreconf --install

before the above commands.

By default, fltiny will install into /usr/local/bin.

If you want to change any of these paths, you can do this with the
configure script too, e.g. './configure --prefix=/usr' will install
fltiny into /usr/bin.

See doc/README for more details.
