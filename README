fltiny README

fltiny is a 'proxy' software, which reads data from server as
client, and send it to a client as server.

This special situation, the server is the Fldigi, and the client
is a serial port, where an Arduino listens, and runs tinyFSK.

fltiny uses Fldigi's xmlrpc interface, so you need the xmlrpc
library (see README in top of source).

The name of the serial port is "/dev/fsk" - you can change it
in serialmodem.c.


Requested packages:
- gcc
- autotools
- libxmlrpc-core-c3-dev
